## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated

### 📡 IP Address Management
- Compared **public vs private IP addresses** on EC2 instances.
- Analyzed the behavior of **dynamic** vs **static (Elastic)** IPs.

### 🧱 Subnetting in VPC
- Designed and created **custom subnets** with CIDR blocks.
- Associated subnets with specific **Availability Zones**.

### 🌐 VPC Networking Resources
- Provisioned key resources:
  - **Internet Gateway**
  - **Route Tables**
  - **NAT Gateway**
  - **Security Groups**
  - **Network ACLs (NACLs)**

### 🛠️ Network Troubleshooting
- Used Linux CLI tools to diagnose and resolve issues:
  - `ping`, `traceroute`, `curl`, `dig`, `nslookup`
- Fixed misconfigured routes, security rules, and DNS issues.

### 🚀 EC2 Deployment
- Launched EC2 instances in **public** and **private** subnets.
- Configured **SSH access**, **Elastic IPs**, and tested connectivity.
- Verified communication between instances and external networks.
