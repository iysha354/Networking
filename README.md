# Networking
Hands on AWS re/start Networking labs and projects. Beginner level for Cloud engineering/ devops

AWS re/Start Networking Labs
This repository contains practical networking labs completed as part of the AWS re/Start program. The labs demonstrate my ability to design, deploy, and troubleshoot cloud networking environments using Amazon VPC and EC2.

🔧 Skills Demonstrated
📡 IP Address Management
Compared public vs private IPs on EC2 instances.

Analyzed behavior of dynamic vs static (Elastic) IPs.

🧱 Subnetting in VPC
Designed and created custom subnets using CIDR blocks.

Assigned subnets to availability zones for high availability.

🌐 VPC Networking Resources
Provisioned core components:

Route Tables

Internet Gateway

NAT Gateway

Security Groups & NACLs

🛠️ Network Troubleshooting
Diagnosed connectivity issues using:

ping, traceroute, curl, dig, nslookup

Resolved misconfigurations in routing, security, and DNS.

🚀 EC2 Deployment
Launched EC2 instances in public and private subnets.

Configured key pairs, Elastic IPs, and SSH access.

Validated internal and external connectivity.
